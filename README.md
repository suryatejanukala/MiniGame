ðŸŽ® Building a Mini-Game with HTML, CSS & JavaScript ðŸ’»ðŸ•¹

I just wrapped up an exciting project where I developed a mini-game using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for game logic and interactivity. The game includes features like a score tracker, timer, and dynamic elements that respond to user input in real-time. Using JavaScript, I implemented game mechanics such as collision detection and score updates, while CSS animations were used to add smooth, engaging visual effects.

One of the key challenges was optimizing performance to ensure the game ran smoothly on all devices, especially mobile. Another challenge was keeping the code modular and scalable for future enhancements or additional features.

Takeaway: Combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript opens up limitless possibilities for interactive projects. This mini-game reinforced the importance of writing efficient code and considering user experience from the start.
